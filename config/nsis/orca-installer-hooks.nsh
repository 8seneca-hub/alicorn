; electron-builder NSIS hooks for the Alicorn Windows installer.
;
; electron-builder accepts exactly ONE `nsis.include` file, so every customInstall /
; customUnInstall hook Alicorn needs lives here.

; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Markdown "Open with Alicorn" (issue #10138)
;
; Why hand-rolled instead of electron-builder's `fileAssociations` on Windows:
; app-builder-lib emits !insertmacro APP_ASSOCIATE, whose first line is
;   WriteRegStr SHELL_CONTEXT "Software\Classes\.md" "" "<ProgID>"
; That overwrites whichever editor currently owns .md, with no backup, for every
; existing user on their next UPDATE - and APP_UNASSOCIATE never restores it, so
; uninstalling Alicorn would leave .md pointing at a deleted ProgID.
;
; These writes are additive only. Registering a ProgID plus an OpenWithProgids
; hint and an Applications\<exe>\SupportedTypes entry puts Alicorn in Explorer's
; "Open with" list and in "Choose another app", while the default handler stays
; exactly where the user left it. Never add a `Software\Classes\.<ext>` default
; value here.
;
; MARKDOWN_PROGID must stay in sync with the extension list handled by
; isMarkdownDocumentName() in src/main/ipc/markdown-documents.ts.
;
; Why the pre-rebrand "Orca.Markdown" ProgID is left untouched rather than
; migrated: `appId` moved to com.8seneca.alicorn, so NSIS treats Alicorn as a
; different product and never runs Orca's uninstaller. An Orca install can still
; be present and still own that ProgID - deleting it here would strip a live
; app's "Open with" entry. It goes away when the user uninstalls Orca.

; Clean up the relocated terminal daemon on a REAL uninstall.
;
; Why: the daemon host is deliberately copied to a distinct image name
; (orca-terminal-daemon.exe) under %LOCALAPPDATA%\Orca\daemon-host so that app
; UPDATES cannot kill it — that relocation is what keeps terminals alive across
; updates. The same design means a normal uninstall's process sweep and file
; removal both miss it, leaving an orphaned daemon plus its runtime copy behind.
;
; The ${isUpdated} guard is essential: electron-builder runs this uninstaller as
; part of uninstallOldVersion on EVERY update, and killing the daemon there would
; defeat the whole feature. Only clean up on a genuine uninstall.
;
; The image name and the LOCALAPPDATA folder name must stay in sync with
; DAEMON_HOST_EXE_NAME and LOCAL_HOST_ROOT_NAME in
; src/main/daemon/daemon-host-relocation.ts.

    Sleep 500
    RMDir /r "$LOCALAPPDATA\Orca\daemon-host"
  ${endIf}
  ; Why outside the ${isUpdated} guard: customInstall rewrites these on every update, so
  ; dropping them during uninstallOldVersion is correct and keeps the pair symmetric.
