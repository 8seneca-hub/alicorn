// receiver logs a warning when it sees a request from a different version so a
// stale script installed by an older app build is diagnosable instead of
// silently producing partial payloads.
//
// v2 is the ORCA_* -> ALICORN_* rename (R4). It is a real wire change: a v1
// script reads and posts the old env names only, and both names are exported
// for exactly one release, so a v1 script left on disk has to read as outdated
// and be reinstalled rather than pass as current.
